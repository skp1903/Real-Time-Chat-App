Real-Time Chat Application with MongoDB Integration

This is a real-time chat application built with Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB. Users can send and receive messages in real time, and messages are stored in MongoDB for persistence.

Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

    Node.js: Install from nodejs.org
    MongoDB: Install locally from mongodb.com or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository or create a new project folder:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-chat-app.git
cd real-time-chat-app

2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

npm init -y
npm install express socket.io mongoose

Backend Setup

    Create server.js: Create a server.js file in the project root directory for setting up the server and MongoDB connection.

Frontend Setup

    Create public/index.html: Inside the public folder, create an index.html file to serve as the chat interface for users.

Running the Application

    Start the server:

node server.js

    The server will start running at http://localhost:3000.

MongoDB Setup

    Start MongoDB (if running locally):

    If MongoDB is not already running, open a new terminal window and start MongoDB:

mongod

    Verify MongoDB Connection:

    Open MongoDB Compass and ensure that your chatApp database is available, and messages are being saved in the messages collection.

This should help you set up and run the real-time chat application with MongoDB integration! Let me know if you need any further clarifications.
